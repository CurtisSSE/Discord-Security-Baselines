# Discord Security Baselines
Open source security baselines for securing a Discord server for internal usage.

Many organizations are now looking to Discord as an alternative communications platform, for sharing internal content and collaborating between teams. In order to secure your organization whilst on Discord, here are some recommended baselines with reasoning. Usually organizations use a body such as CIS (Center for Internet Security) baselines when securing some form of deployment. This project is open to interpretation, by no means the 'be all and end all' of how to secure and moderate a server - if you have suggestions or corrections, please feel free to do a pull request.
